# NeuroNudge
NeuroNudge - a multimodal emotion-aware companion for e-learning that detects learner affect (face, speech, and mouse behaviour) and adapts content in real time.
# Emotion Recognition in E-Learning Systems Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

> NeuroNudge — a multimodal, emotion-aware companion that enhances online learning by recognizing learner emotions through face, voice, and behaviour data.

---

## 📘 Overview
This project presents **NeuroNudge**, an intelligent e-learning framework that integrates **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** to recognize students’ emotions and adapt course delivery in real time.  
It aims to increase learner engagement, motivation, and performance by detecting emotional cues and dynamically modifying instructional content.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect emotions using **facial expressions, speech tone, and behavioural cues**.
- Combine multimodal data to compute an **engagement score**.
- Provide **adaptive learning modes** such as Baby, Story, Quiz, and Resource.
- Deliver **real-time feedback** using gamification and dashboards.
- Improve e-learning systems’ emotional intelligence and responsiveness.

---

## 🧠 Key Features
- Facial emotion recognition using **OpenCV** and CNN-based models.  
- Speech tone detection using **MFCC** and ML classifiers (SVM / LSTM).  
- Behavioural analytics from mouse and interaction data.  
- Real-time multimodal fusion for emotion estimation.  
- Adaptive learning engine that selects modes dynamically.  
- Gamified interface with progress tracking and mood visualization.
